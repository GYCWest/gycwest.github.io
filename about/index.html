	<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
	<p>GYC West is an organization of Seventh-day Adventist youth and young adults in the western United States. We believe that the Lord is forming His army of workers in these last days and our prayer is that GYC West would be a vessel through which Jesus Christ can reveal His will.</p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>GYC West seeks to provide an annual conference featuring high quality messages for young people living in the western portion of our country. We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. If you are planning on being in the area, we invite you to come. We also invite you to use this conference as a means of personal evangelism for friends of yours that may be struggling in their faith. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17. We hope to see you there!</p>

	<h1>Inspiration Box</h1>

		<h1>Claudia Velasco, VP of Communications</h1>
		<img src="/img/staff/2020/2020Claudia.jpg"/>
		<p>It was not until late high school that Claudia met God who has since healed her and given her the desire to led others to Christ for healing. She completed her nursing school at Weimar Institute in 2018 and has been practicing in hospital settings. Recently, she has seen a vision from God to enter medical missionary work and has left her job. She continues to be actively involved in young adult bible studies and encouraging others in the faith and genuine Christianity. Other pursuits she enjoys is running, reading biblical counseling, podcasts, learning new crafts and being an undiscovered food critic. ;)</p>

		<h1>Anya Kinsley, VP of Programming</h1>
		<img src="/img/staff/2020/2020Anya.jpg"/>
		<p>She currently works as a dermatology nurse with her dad in Northern California, where they are working together to develop and launch an outpatient wellness program to help address health needs in their community. She also has a love for the arts and works part-time as an artist/graphic designer. In her free time, Anya enjoys reading, adventuring, trying new things, making things (food, art, pottery, etc), potting plants and enjoying nature.</p>
		<p>Anya's favorite part about the Bible is the complete restoration of mind, character and body God desires to accomplish in His people and promises to accomplish in all who will let Him. He bids us “Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.” Isaiah 43:18,19</p>

		<h1>Ricky Curtice, VP of Technology</h1>
		<img src="/img/staff/2018/2018Ricky.jpg"/>
		<p>I am a life-long Seventh-day Adventist, attending Granite Bay SDA church where I volunteer in the media ministry - mostly in audio.</p>
		<p>Outside of church I am a software developer and mechanical engineer. I have my B.S. in Game and Simulation Programming, where I learnt enough about the underlying principles of game development to be certain that Christians have neither the time to waste on such games nor should they suffer the damage induced by them.</p>
