      <description>#inspiration_box { background-image: url(&#34;/img/texture-2136831.jpg&#34;); background-position: center; background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; }   An Explanation GYC West seeks to provide an annual conference featuring high quality messages for young people living in the western portion of our country. We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17.</description>

These are questions that too many times go unanswered. Many of us young people are leaving the church because we donâ€™t understand at its core what it means to be a Seventh-day Adventist. We want to be part of something that is more than just a list of beliefs.</description>
