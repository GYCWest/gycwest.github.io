We believe in the power of convocation and that when two or more are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is there in the midst of us. We know the Lord will bless as we seek the unity that Christ wants for His church as exemplified in the Gospel of John chapter 17.</description>

      <description>.written_by { text-align: right; font-style: italic; }   The Modern Day Identity Crisis Who are we? Where do we come from? What does it mean to be a Seventh-day Adventist? These are questions that too many times go unanswered. Many of us young people are leaving the church because we don’t understand at its core what it means to be a Seventh-day Adventist. We want to be part of something that is more than just a list of beliefs.</description>
